# Coding workflow preferences
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- For every major feature, write detailed documentation in a .md file and save to a /docs folder. For every new documentation file, update an overview.md file also saved in /docs that indexes all of the documentation files
